# genetic-scheduler
A genetic algorithm that takes a list of classes and students and makes an ideal schedule. 
I created this program in python as a way to explore and learn machine learning principles.
Feel free to copy the code and change to parameters such as number of offspring and mutation rate and your results will vary.
Here is a link to a youtube video explaining the code https://youtu.be/iJ65a_4MhwI
